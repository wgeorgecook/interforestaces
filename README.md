# Inter-forest-aces
Are you a Go developer who wants a solid reference for how interfaces and struct composition work? Look no further! This package has all you need. Inside of `package trees` you will find the interface `ITree` which has several methods. Some of those methods are satisfied by the concrete `Tree` struct. However, the seasonal methods are implemented by concrete types in `package deciduous` and `package conifer`. You can play around with this to discover how the structs are all related. Experiment and see why a `trees.New()` can't be passed into the `trees.Lifecycle()` function, but both a `conifer.New()` and a `deciduous.New()` can!
